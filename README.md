# Pseudo Bank Website

This project simulates a basic bank website, using JavaScript array methods and DOM manipulation for handling banking functionalities. Users can interact with the platform to filter, sort, and calculate their transactions.

## Features

- **Array Methods**: 
  - `map()`: Apply functions to each transaction.
  - `filter()`: Filter transactions based on criteria.
  - `reduce()`: Aggregate transactions (e.g., total spending/income).
  - `sort()`: Organize transactions.
  
- **DOM Manipulation**: To dynamically update the UI based on user actions.

- **Timing Functions**: 
  - `setTimeout()`: Delay execution of functions.
  - `setInterval()`: Repeatedly execute functions at regular intervals.

## Usage

- **Trial Credentials**: 
  - Username: `JS`
  - Password: `1111`

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core language for array methods and DOM handling.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the interface.
